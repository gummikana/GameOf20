Game of 20
==========

Goal
----

The goal is to have the lowest score at the end of the game. Your score is the sum of the tiles remaining in your 'hand'. The game ends when both players have run out of valid moves.

Setup
-----
Both players start with the following tiles in their 'hands': 1, 1, 2

One of the center tiles is randomly selected and placed in the center of the board.

The starting player is randomly selected. The starting player takes one of the remaining tiles (3 to 20).
Players then take turns selecting 2 of the remaining tiles at a time. This is continued until there is one tile left, which goes to the second player.

Both players should have 12 tiles in their 'hands'. 'Hands' are kept visible, so both players can see each other's tiles.

Rules
-----
The player with the higher sum of numbers in their 'hand' goes first. Players take turns placing one tile at a time on the board according to the tile placement rules.

On your turn you must place a tile on the board if there is a valid move for you to make.

The rules of placing tiles:

Grid spaces are considered to be adjacent if they share an edge.

If an empty space has 1 or zero adjacent tiles then only the lowest number tile you have can be placed there.
If an empty space has 2 or more adjacent tiles then only the tile that is the sum of the adjacent tiles can be placed there.

The game continues until no more valid moves are available. After that both players count up the values of the tiles that remain in their 'hands'. The player with a lower total wins.


Solo Variant
------------

Solo variant is played the same way a 2 player game is, but you will play both players. The differences are that the game ends immediately if one of the players can't place anything onto the board any more. Your score is total of all the remaining (both players) tiles.
